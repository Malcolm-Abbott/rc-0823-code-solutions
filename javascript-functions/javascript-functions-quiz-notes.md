## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

A JavaScript Object type containing code block which will be executed upon being called.
Functions are incredibly useful as they allow you to package up code for later use in your program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

Function definitions are made up of:
1.) the function keyword
2.) an optional name
3.) zero or more parameters
4.) a code block (defined by opening and closing curly braces, all the code you wish to run goes inside here)
5.) an optional return statement (useful for returning values which result from expressions inside of the code block)

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

Functions are called with () parentheses and passed zero or more arguments.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

Function definition simply creates the existence of the function in the memory base (stores the value of the written code there)
A function call references that location in the memory data base and performs the actions within its code block with the option of inputting data into that code block to manipulate via the calling of arguments.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A parameter is the placeholder variable which will be assigned the value of the argument.
A parameter is declared when defining a function.
Arguments are passed when calling a function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

Because they essentially serve as placeholders for values which will be passed as arguments, therefore making the function more dynamic and customizalbe and expands the utility functionality of functions in general.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

A return statement causes the function to produce a value.
A return statement also exits the function; no code after the return statement is executed.
