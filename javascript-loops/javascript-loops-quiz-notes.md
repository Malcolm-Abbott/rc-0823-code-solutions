## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

To automate a task execution for a specified numbers of times based on the conditional logic specified.
To automate tasks which you would like to perform for a certain number of times (or iterations) based on criteria of conditional logic which you specify.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

To use them to determine which code block should be executed (based on the conditional logic that you provide). So it gives your code increased functionality, keeps your code DRY and efficient (when used in the correct occasions of course).

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

A single execution of the loop body is called an iteration.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

The conditional expression of a while loop gets evaluated at the beginning of each iteration followed by the execution of the following code block provided that the conditional expression resulted in a truthy operand until the conditional expression no longer results in a falsy operand in which case the loop is terminated and no longer ran.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

At the beginning of the loop's execution, and is only run that one time (it is not ran each iteration).

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

After the initialization has run, the conditional expression will be evaluated to a Boolean operand.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

After the code black has run as a result of the conditional expression resulting in a truthy operand.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

the break directive

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

it increases the value of the variable in which it's appended to.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?

Using a for..in loop.
