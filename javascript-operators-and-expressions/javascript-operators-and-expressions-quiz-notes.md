## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data type is returned by an arithmetic operation?

1. Number: if both operands of an arithmetic operations are numeric values(numbers), the result will be a numeric value, which is of the `number` data type.
2. String: if at least one operand is a string, JAvaScript performs type coercion, converitng the other operand to a string, and the operation results in a string.
3. NaN: if an arithmetic operation involves non-numeric values, or if the operation is mathematically undefined (such as dividing by zero), the result will be `NaN` (Not-a-Number).

It's important to note that JavaScript's type coercion can lead to unexpected results. so it's crucial to be aware of the types of operands you're using in arithmetic operations.

- What is string concatenation?

Using the adddition operator to join one string to another string in the direction of left to right.

- What purpose(s) does the `+` plus operator serve in JavaScript?

Binary Addition Operator: To add the operand on the right hand side to the operand on the left hand side.
unary plus operator: converts a value that is not a number into a number

- What data type is returned by comparing two values (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc)?

A boolean value.

- What does the `+=` "plus-equals" operator do?

It adds the operation on the right hand side of the addition assignment operator to the operand on the left hand side and assigns that value to the operand on the left hand side.
